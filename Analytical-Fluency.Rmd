abstract: |
  Scientific analysis is formally presented as a rigid process typically
  comprising: Review; Theory; Research question; Methodology;
  Experiment; Analysis, Evaluation; and Conclusions.

  We do, however, question whether established methods for managing and
  analysing data are still appropriate for "Big Data", by which we mean
  data that is too big to be conveniently manipulated by manually
  intensive methods.

  This presents two questions which we seek to address here: the first
  is to justify why there is a need for new analytical techniques, given
  that the existing ones still work; the second is to show how an
  abstract perception of data impacts the analytical process.

  An example of the motivation for change is illustrated by the "Grammar
  of Graphics" (GoG) paradigm. GoG uses combinations of transforms to
  generate every possible graphic and tabulation from data presented in
  a suitable state allowing for a radical change in the analytic
  workflow, while still preserving the goals of scientific analysis.

  By framing this problem as one of transforming *data state*, we can
  mathematically describe general properties allowing the creation of
  re-usable code templates for data preparation. Coupled with "literate
  programming" techniques we show that this approach enables
  analytically fluent analysis of complex data.
