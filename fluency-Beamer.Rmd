# An Initial Analysis

![](images/DescriptiveAnalysis.png)

-   You need to have a nominal description of the data, plus a nominal intention to plan the analysis.

-   This could be as simple as "Look for time related trends".

-   A descriptive analysis is a good place to start as this will also confirm that the data aligns with the nominal description.

# The manual way to analyse data
